This project is created to test the complete GitHub integration workflow of the JSON to Archive Converter.

## Test Objectives

2. ✅ **Individual File Pushing**: Confirm files are pushed individually (not as zip)
3. ✅ **MongoDB Storage**: Ensure project data is stored in database
4. ✅ **Project Updates**: Test updating existing projects
5. ✅ **History Tracking**: Verify update history is maintained

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: FastAPI with GitHub API integration
- **Database**: MongoDB for project storage
- **Deployment**: Render integration (optional)
- **Token**: GitHub Personal Access Token with 'repo' scope

## Files Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file with test content
- `styles.css` - CSS styling for the test page
- `script.js` - JavaScript functionality testing
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Test Results

If you can see this repository on GitHub with all files properly organized, the integration is working correctly!
